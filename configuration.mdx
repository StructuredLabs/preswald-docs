When initializing a new Preswald project with `preswald init`, a default `config.toml` file is created. This file defines core settings for the app, including logging, theming, and data connections. Data connections can include databases like PostgreSQL or local CSV files.

## Default Configuration (`config.toml`)

The following is the default structure of `config.toml` created during initialization:

### Example `config.toml`

```toml
[project]
title = "My Preswald App"
version = "0.1.0"
port = 8501

[branding]
name = "Preswald Project"
logo = "images/logo.png"
favicon = "images/favicon.ico"
primaryColor = "#F89613"

[data.postgres]
type = "postgres"
host = "localhost"
port = 5432
dbname = "example_db"
user = "user"

[data.csv]
type = "csv"
path = "data/example.csv"
delimiter = ","
header = true

[logging]
level = "INFO"  # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
format = "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
```

## Configuration Sections

### `[project]`

- `title`: Name of the app displayed in the interface.
- `version`: Version of the app.
- `port`: Port the app runs on (default is `8501`).

### `[branding]`

- `name`: Displayed name of the app.
- `logo`: Path to the logo file (relative to the project directory).
- `favicon`: Path to the favicon file.
- `primaryColor`: The primary UI color, specified as a CSS-compatible color (e.g., `#3498db`).

---

## Connecting to Data Sources

### PostgreSQL Example: `[data.postgres]`

- `type`: Use `"postgres"` for PostgreSQL.
- `host`: Hostname or IP of the database server.
- `port`: Port number for the database (default is `5432`).
- `dbname`: Name of the database.
- `user`: Username for database access.

### CSV Example: `[data.csv]`

You can use a local CSV file as a data source by defining it in `config.toml`.

#### Fields:

- `type`: Use `"csv"` to specify that this connection refers to a CSV file.
- `path`: Relative or absolute path to the CSV file.
- `delimiter`: The character used to separate values (e.g., `,` or `;`).
- `header`: Set to `true` if the CSV file contains a header row, otherwise `false`.

#### Example CSV Connection:

```toml
[data.csv]
type = "csv"
path = "data/customers.csv"
delimiter = ","
header = true
```

If the CSV file is located in a subdirectory, make sure the `path` is correct relative to the root directory.

## Logging Configuration

The `[logging]` section allows you to control the verbosity and format of logs generated by the app.

### Fields:

- `level`: Minimum severity level for log messages. Options:
  - `DEBUG`: Logs detailed debugging information.
  - `INFO`: Logs general app activity.
  - `WARNING`: Logs warnings or potential issues.
  - `ERROR`: Logs critical errors.
  - `CRITICAL`: Logs only severe issues that cause immediate failure.
- `format`: Specifies the format of the log messages. Common placeholders:
  - `%(asctime)s`: Timestamp of the log entry.
  - `%(name)s`: Name of the logger.
  - `%(levelname)s`: Severity level of the log.
  - `%(message)s`: Log message content.

### Example Logging Setup:

```toml
[logging]
level = "DEBUG"
format = "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
```

This configuration generates detailed logs, including timestamps, logger names, and log messages.
