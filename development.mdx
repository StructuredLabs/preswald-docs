<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install Python (version 3.7 or higher) and pip before
  proceeding.
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run Preswald on your operating system:

**Step 1**: Install Preswald:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install preswald
```

```bash pip
python -m pip install preswald
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to your project directory (where your `preswald.config.json` file is located) and execute the following command:

```bash
preswald run
```

Your data app and dashboards will be available for preview at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Custom Ports

By default, Preswald uses port 8000. You can customize the port by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Preswald on port 8080, use this command:

```bash
preswald run --port 8080
```

If the specified port is already in use, Preswald will automatically use the next available port:

```md
Port 8000 is already in use. Trying 8001 instead.
```

## Preswald Versions

Please ensure your CLI version matches the latest Preswald SDK version. If your local app doesn't align with production, update the SDK by running:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install --upgrade preswald
```

```bash pip
python -m pip install --upgrade preswald
```

</CodeGroup>

## Validating Configuration

The CLI can assist with validating your project configuration. To check for any configuration issues, use the following command:

```bash
preswald validate
```

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Preswald provides seamless deployment to Vercel for quick and easy sharing of
  your data apps.
</Tip>

To deploy your app, use the following command:

```bash
preswald deploy
```

If the deployment is successful, you will see a confirmation message with a live preview link:
