## Authentication

Preswald CLI commands requiring access to external services use an environment-based configuration. Set your credentials in an `.env` file or export them as environment variables.

```bash
export PRESWALD_API_KEY=your_api_key
export PRESWALD_DB_CONNECTION=your_database_connection_string
```

## CLI Commands Overview

Here’s an overview of the key CLI commands available in the Preswald SDK.

### `preswald init`

Initialize a new project with a predefined structure.

```bash
preswald init <project_name>
```

This creates a folder structure for ingestion, transformation, and visualization scripts. Example:

```bash
preswald init sales_analytics
```

Output:

```
Created project 'sales_analytics' with default folder structure.
```

### `preswald run`

Run the Preswald development server to preview your app and pipelines locally.

```bash
preswald run [--port <port_number>]
```

Example:

```bash
preswald run --port 8080
```

This starts a local server at `http://localhost:8080` to preview your pipelines and dashboards.

### `preswald pipeline run`

Execute a specific pipeline from your project.

```bash
preswald pipeline run <pipeline_name>
```

Example:

```bash
preswald pipeline run load_sales_data
```

Output:

```
Pipeline 'load_sales_data' executed successfully.
Rows processed: 10,234
Duration: 3.2 seconds
```

### `preswald api generate`

Generate an API endpoint from a data model.

```bash
preswald api generate <model_name>
```

Example:

```bash
preswald api generate sales_summary
```

Output:

```
API endpoint generated:
GET /api/sales_summary
```

### `preswald deploy`

Deploy your app to Vercel or a configured hosting platform.

```bash
preswald deploy
```

This command automatically sets up deployment, generates a live preview link, and secures environment variables.

Output:

```
Deployment successful!
Live preview: https://sales-analytics.vercel.app
```

    Verify that your database credentials are correctly set in the `.env` file or as environment variables. Example:
    ```bash
    export PRESWALD_DB_CONNECTION=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/db
    ```
