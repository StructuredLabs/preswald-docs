## CLI Commands Overview

Here‚Äôs an overview of the key CLI commands available in the Preswald SDK.

### Installation

First, install the Preswald SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install preswald
```

Once installed, verify the installation by running:

```bash
python -c "import preswald; print('Preswald installed successfully!')"
```

### `preswald init`

Initialize a new project with a predefined structure.

```bash
preswald init <project_name>
```

This creates a folder structure for ingestion, transformation, and visualization scripts. Example:

```bash
preswald init my_first_app
```

Output:

```
my_first_app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hello.py          # Example app file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.toml       # Theme and app settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ secrets.toml      # API keys and sensitive information
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore        # Preconfigured for secrets.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # Project documentation
```

### Write Your First App

Open the `hello.py` file in your new project and modify it as follows:

```
from preswald import text

# Add Markdown text

text("# Hello, Preswald!")
text("This is your first interactive data app.")
```

#### Connect to Data

Use the `connect` function to load data from a CSV file, JSON, or a database:

```
from preswald import text, connect, view

# Connect to a CSV file
connection = connect("data.csv", "my_data")

# Render the data as a table
text("### Data Preview")
view(connection)
```

---

### `preswald run`

Start the development server to preview your app:

```bash
preswald run [--port <port_number>]
```

Example:

```bash
preswald run --port 8080
```

By default, your app will run at `http://localhost:8501`. Open this URL in your browser to see your app in action!

```
üåê App running at: http://localhost:8501
```

### `preswald deploy`

Deploy your app to Vercel or a configured hosting platform.

```bash
preswald deploy
```

This command automatically sets up deployment, generates a live preview link, and secures environment variables.

Output:

```
Deployment successful!
Live preview: https://sales-analytics.vercel.app
```
