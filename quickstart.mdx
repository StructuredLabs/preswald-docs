## Step 1: Install the Preswald SDK

First, install the SDK from PyPI:

```bash
pip install preswald
```

Need the latest version? Upgrade anytime:

```bash
pip install --upgrade preswald
```

That’s it! You’re ready to start building.

---

## Step 2: Set Up Your First Project

#### Initialize Your Project

Run these commands to bootstrap your first Preswald app:

```bash
preswald init my_project
cd my_project
```

This will create a scaffolded project with the following:

- **`hello.py`**: A starter Python script to get you going.
- **`config.toml`**: Your app’s configuration settings.
- **`secrets.toml`**: A secure place for sensitive data.
- **`.gitignore`**: Pre-configured to exclude sensitive files from version control.

#### Write Your First App

Open `hello.py` and edit it with the following content:

```python
from preswald import text

text("# Welcome to Preswald")
```

#### Run It Locally

Launch your app locally with this command:

```bash
preswald run hello.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to **[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)**. Your app will be live, ready for you to explore and iterate on.

---

## Step 3: Deploy Your App

When you're ready to deploy your app, Preswald gives you flexibility:

#### Deploy Locally

If you just want to test your container locally:

```bash
preswald deploy --target local hello.py
```

Or simply:

```bash
preswald deploy hello.py
```

This performs a local "dry run" by building the container locally.

#### Deploy to the Cloud

To deploy your app to **Google Cloud Run**, ensure you have the Google Cloud CLI installed. If not, the CLI will guide you through the installation process.

Deploy with the following command:

```bash
preswald deploy --target gcp hello.py
```

You can also specify other cloud providers like AWS, or keep the default configuration for local execution.

### Example Deployment Commands

- **Google Cloud Run**:

  ```bash
  preswald deploy --target gcp hello.py
  ```

- **Local Container (Dry Run)**:

  ```bash
  preswald deploy --target local hello.py
  ```

Preswald handles everything, from configuration to execution, giving you a shareable live preview link.
