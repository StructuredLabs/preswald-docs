# `WorkflowAnalyzer()`

The `WorkflowAnalyzer` class provides tools to analyze and optimize workflows built using the `Workflow` class. It offers insights into critical paths, parallel execution opportunities, and dependency visualizations, enabling you to fine-tune workflows for efficiency.

---

## Parameters

- **`workflow`** _(Workflow object)_: The workflow to be analyzed. This must be an instance of the `Workflow` class.

---

## Methods

### `analyzer.get_critical_path()`

Identifies the critical path in the workflow. The critical path represents the sequence of dependent atoms that determines the total execution time.

#### Returns:

- **`critical_path`** _(list)_: A list of atom names in the critical path, highlighting the workflow bottleneck.

---

### `analyzer.get_parallel_groups()`

Identifies groups of atoms that can be computed in parallel, helping you optimize execution.

#### Returns:

- **`parallel_groups`** _(list of lists)_: Each sublist contains atom names that can be computed simultaneously.

---

### `analyzer.visualize(highlight_path=None, title="Workflow Dependency Graph")`

Generates a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) visualization of the workflow.

#### Parameters:

- **`highlight_path`** _(list, optional)_: A list of atom names to highlight in the visualization (e.g., the critical path). If not provided, the entire DAG is displayed.
- **`title`** _(str, optional)_: The title of the visualization. Defaults to `"Workflow Dependency Graph"`.

#### Returns:

- **Plotly Chart**: An interactive visualization of the workflow's dependencies.

## Usage Example

```python
from preswald import Workflow, WorkflowAnalyzer
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample workflow
workflow = Workflow()

@workflow.atom()
def load_data():
    return pd.read_csv("data.csv")

@workflow.atom(dependencies=['load_data'])
def clean_data(load_data):
    return load_data.dropna()

@workflow.atom(dependencies=['clean_data'])
def analyze_data(clean_data):
    return clean_data.describe()

# Initialize the WorkflowAnalyzer
analyzer = WorkflowAnalyzer(workflow)

# Execute the workflow
workflow.execute()

# Visualize the workflow
fig = analyzer.visualize(title="Workflow Dependency Graph")
fig.show()  # Opens visualization in a web browser

# Identify and display the critical path
critical_path = analyzer.get_critical_path()
print("Critical path:", ' -> '.join(critical_path))

# Visualize the critical path
fig_critical = analyzer.visualize(
    highlight_path=critical_path,
    title="Workflow Critical Path"
)
fig_critical.show()

# Identify and display parallel execution groups
parallel_groups = analyzer.get_parallel_groups()
print("\nParallel execution groups:")
for i, group in enumerate(parallel_groups, 1):
    print(f"Group {i}: {', '.join(group)}")
```
