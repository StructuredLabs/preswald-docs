WorkflowAnalyzer()

Parameters:
IN: takes in a Workflow object

analyzer.get_critical_path():
IN: none
OUT: critical_path: list of atoms, workflow bottleneck. Profiler of the execution time for all the atoms

analyzer.get_parallel_groups() – shows which nodes can be computed at the same time – optimization
analyzer.visualize() opens up a new page with a DAG showing the dependencies of the atoms
IN:
highlight_path: takes in a list of atoms
Path is optional - if path is not passed in it will show the whole dag
Title: name describing what is visualized
OUT:
Plotly chart

# Show critical path

# Show parallel execution groups
