RetryPolicy

Defines how retries should be handled for failed atoms. Can be passed to atom or to workflow. If both are specified then the atom’s retrypolicy overrides the workflows. Optional, default value provided.

Parameters:

IN:

All optional (from the perspective of the user)
Max_attempts (int),
delay – seconds (float),
backoff_factor – increase time delay between each failed attempt, (float),
retry_exceptions – the exceptions on which you should retry (by default, it’s all) (Error)

Default values:

def **init**(
self,
max_attempts: int = 3,
delay: float = 1.0,
backoff_factor: float = 2.0,
retry_exceptions: tuple = (Exception,),
):

workflow = Workflow(
default_retry_policy=RetryPolicy(
max_attempts=3,
delay=1.0,
backoff_factor=2.0,
retry_exceptions=(IOError, TimeoutError)
)
)
