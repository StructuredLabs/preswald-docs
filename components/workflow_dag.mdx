```python
workflow_dag(workflow: preswald.Workflow, title="Workflow Dependency Graph")
```

The `workflow_dag` function renders a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) visualization for a given workflow. This helps you visualize dependencies and relationships within the workflow, making it easier to understand and debug complex processes.

## Parameters

- **`workflow`**: A workflow object representing the process or pipeline to be visualized.
- **`title`** _(str)_: _(Optional)_ The title displayed above the visualization. Defaults to `"Workflow Dependency Graph"`.

## Returns

- **Plotly Chart**: An interactive Plotly chart representing the workflow's DAG.

## Usage Example

Here‚Äôs an example of how to visualize a workflow using `workflow_dag`:

```python
from preswald import workflow_dag, Workflow

# Create a workflow object
workflow = Workflow()

# Render the workflow DAG
workflow_dag(workflow, title="Example Workflow")
```

### Key Features

1. **Visualize Dependencies**: Provides a clear representation of task dependencies in the workflow.
2. **Interactive Exploration**: Zoom, pan, and hover over nodes to inspect details.
3. **Customizable Title**: Add meaningful titles to make the visualization more descriptive.

### Example Use Case

Imagine you‚Äôre working on a data pipeline with multiple interconnected tasks:

- Use `workflow_dag` to render a visual map of how tasks depend on one another.
- Quickly identify bottlenecks, cycles, or missing connections in your workflow.

### Why Use `workflow_dag`?

- **Clarity**: Converts complex workflows into easy-to-understand visuals.
- **Diagnostics**: Spot issues or inefficiencies in the workflow structure.
- **Professional Presentation**: Share high-quality visualizations with stakeholders or team members.

Simplify and visualize your workflows effortlessly with `workflow_dag`! üõ†Ô∏è
