### 3. **Localhost Access**

The app is hosted on `localhost`, which is a local server accessible only from your machine. Use the provided URL to interact with your app through a browser.

### 4. **Stopping the Server**

To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the command is running.
