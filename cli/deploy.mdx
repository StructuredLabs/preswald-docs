# `preswald deploy <file_name>`

The `preswald deploy` command deploys your application to a desired environment, such as Google Cloud Run, AWS, or a local container. It streamlines the deployment process, handling configuration and execution seamlessly.

## Arguments

- **`file_name` (str):**  
  The path to the Python script that contains your application code. This is the script to be deployed.

## Options

- **`--target`**: Specifies the deployment target. Options include:
  - `cloud-run`: Deploys to Google Cloud Run. Requires GCloud CLI installed.
  - `gcp`: Alias for deploying to Google Cloud.
  - `aws`: Deploys to AWS (additional configurations required).
  - `local` (default): Builds and runs a container locally without deploying to the cloud.

---

## Requirements for Cloud Deployment

- **Google Cloud Run Deployment:**  
  Ensure that the [GCloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) is installed and configured on your system. If not, the CLI will provide guidance on setup.

---

## Example Deployment Commands

### 1. **Google Cloud Run Deployment**

To deploy your app to Google Cloud Run:

```bash
preswald deploy --target cloud-run hello.py
```

This command packages your app into a container and deploys it to Google Cloud Run, providing a shareable live preview link.

---

### 2. **AWS Deployment** (Coming soon!)

To deploy your app to AWS:

```bash
preswald deploy --target aws hello.py
```

Ensure AWS CLI is installed and configured before running this command.

---

### 3. **Local Deployment (Dry Run)**

To build and test your app locally without deploying it to the cloud:

```bash
preswald deploy --target local hello.py
```

This creates a container locally for testing purposes.

---

### 4. **Default Deployment**

If no `--target` is specified, the deployment defaults to local execution:

```bash
preswald deploy hello.py
```

This builds and runs your app in a local container.

---

## What Preswald Handles

- **Cloud Deployment:** Automates the process of containerizing your app, configuring the environment, and deploying it to the target platform.
- **Local Testing:** Builds a container locally to let you verify your app before cloud deployment.
- **Live Preview:** Provides a shareable URL (for cloud deployments) so others can interact with your app.

---

With `preswald deploy`, you can transition from local testing to cloud deployment in a few simple steps, making your app accessible to a broader audience.
