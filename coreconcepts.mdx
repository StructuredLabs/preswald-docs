title: "Core Concepts"
description: "The technical principles and design philosophy of Preswald."
---

Preswald is engineered to simplify the process of creating dashboards and data applications by focusing on a few core principles: **declarative design**, **data as a first-class citizen**, and **efficient deployment**. These concepts are at the foundation of its architecture and influence every aspect of how it is used.

---

### 1. **Declarative Design**

Preswald is built on the idea that describing what an application should do is more efficient than specifying how to do it. A single configuration file, `config.toml`, defines the application's behavior, presentation, and data connections. This approach reflects key principles:

- **Explicit Structure**: Applications have a clear and predictable configuration that separates logic from setup.
- **Portability**: The declarative nature of the configuration ensures that applications can be reproduced or shared with minimal effort.
- **Focus on Logic**: Engineers can concentrate on what their application should achieve instead of dealing with repetitive setup tasks.

By using declarative design, Preswald shifts complexity away from the developer, allowing for faster iteration and easier maintenance.

### 2. **Data-Centric Architecture**

Preswald treats data as the central element of its architecture. It integrates directly with **DuckDB**, a columnar in-memory database, enabling efficient analytics without requiring a heavyweight backend. This reflects several technical priorities:

- **Direct Integration**: Preswald works natively with structured data formats like CSV and Parquet, reducing the need for intermediate steps.
- **In-Memory Analytics**: DuckDB processes data directly in memory, optimizing for analytical workloads and query performance.
- **Dynamic Data Interactions**: Applications interact with live data, enabling dynamic visualizations and parameter-driven workflows without additional complexity.

This design ensures that the pipeline from raw data to visualization is as direct as possible, minimizing unnecessary abstractions.

### 3. **Interactive Components as Building Blocks**

Preswald provides a library of interactive components that operate as composable building blocks. These components allow developers to create dynamic, user-driven applications while remaining focused on their data logic. Key technical principles include:

- **State-Driven Interaction**: Components like `slider()` and `selectbox()` allow users to interact with the data pipeline by directly modifying parameters or filters.
- **Declarative Behavior**: Each component is defined with a simple function, abstracting away the implementation details of the underlying UI or state management.
- **Integration with Data**: Components are designed to tightly couple with data processing logic, enabling a seamless feedback loop between user input and application output.

This approach ensures that engineers can construct highly interactive applications without needing to build or maintain complex UI layers.

### 4. **Efficiency and Lightweight Execution**

Preswald's execution model prioritizes efficiency by leveraging lightweight, in-process execution and local-first design principles. Key aspects include:

- **Minimized Resource Footprint**: Applications run locally or in-memory using DuckDB, reducing the need for additional infrastructure during development.
- **Optimized for Analytics**: Queries and transformations are executed within the same process, reducing latency and overhead.
- **Local-First Workflow**: Development occurs in an environment that mirrors production behavior, ensuring consistency between testing and deployment.

This efficiency-driven design makes Preswald particularly suited for engineers looking for high performance without unnecessary infrastructure overhead.

---

### 5. **Pragmatic Deployment Model**

Preswald is built around the idea that deploying an application should be straightforward and adaptable to different environments. The deployment process is designed to prioritize control and transparency:

- **Explicit Targets**: Applications can be deployed locally for testing or to cloud environments such as Google Cloud Run, without requiring complex orchestration tools.
- **Container-Based Isolation**: Every application is packaged as a container, ensuring consistency across environments.
- **Developer Control**: Deployment involves explicit steps and decisions, ensuring that engineers retain full visibility into the process.

This model avoids hidden complexity and keeps the focus on delivering functional applications.

---

### 6. **Minimalism and Composability**

Preswald is intentionally minimal in scope. It provides only the tools necessary to define, build, and deploy data applications, leaving room for integration with other systems or libraries. This philosophy is reflected in:

- **Focused Features**: Preswald avoids unnecessary features or abstractions, reducing cognitive load and increasing reliability.
- **Composability**: Applications and workflows can be composed from small, independent pieces, making it easier to build modular systems.
- **Transparent Design**: The architecture is simple and explicit, making it easy to understand and debug.

By adhering to minimalism, Preswald ensures that it remains adaptable and developer-friendly.

### Philosophy: Tools That Stay Out of the Way

Preswald is designed for engineers who value simplicity, performance, and control. It avoids imposing heavy-handed frameworks or opinions, instead focusing on providing the tools needed to turn raw data into actionable insights. By adhering to principles of declarative design, efficient execution, and composability, Preswald reflects a core belief:

**Good tools make complexity manageable without obscuring it.**
